          Jigsimur health drink is a blend of specifically chosen powerful natural herbs and roots that have been clinically demonstrated to prevent and treat common illnesses and persistent disorders.
  Jigsimur was created by Dr. Jonathan Smith, who used herbs to heal himself after learning that he had cancer. He conducted research and found a recipe, which he followed for 11 months, killing the cancer cells. He then returned to the hospital and was declared cancer-free. His remarkable recovery from the deadly malignancy shocked his fellow medical workers, and he began disseminating the recipe after learning it could treat a variety of illnesses. Later, they learned that even those with HIV may be cured of the virus, as South Africa has a high rate of HIV infection. He then chose to bottle it, which is how Jigsimur came to be.
  The key ingredient in Jigsimur herbal drink is the Aloe Ferox plant cultivated in South Africa’s Western Cape.
  Aloe Ferox is a native South African plant that is known for having many health benefits. It’s full of nutrients that are good for your skin, your immune system, and your antioxidants. The plant’s bitter sap has powerful antioxidants that help protect against reactive stress. Aloe Ferox may also aid digestive health and offers a nutrient-rich profile with important minerals and amino acids. Its flexibility allows for topical application in skincare and incorporation into dietary supplements for internal health benefits. While enjoying its natural goodness, it’s essential to practice caution and consult healthcare professionals, especially for individuals with existing health conditions. 
  Jigsimur has been in existence since 1998 and is fully registered in Nigeria with NAFDAC No: A7- 2720L
